### Project Description:
This assignment uses JavaScript to build a tax calculator that takes a user’s input for taxable income and filing status to return an estimate of the tax rate and approximate tax amount that the user will pay.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Decision-making in JavaScript or any other kind of programming is the process of determining the order in which statements are executed in a program. JavaScript statements used for decision-making include: 1) decision-making statements, 2) decision-making structures, and 3) conditional statements. 
    
    The “if” statement is the most common type of decision-making statement. After an “if" statement executes its specific program code, any subsequent code written after the statement executes as it normally would. “If" statements are written using a command block, a set of statements that are contained and executed from a set of braces. 

    To build on “if" statements, you can also use "if/else" statements to execute code based on more than one condition. In this case, the code is executed if the condition is true or false. Statements can be listed within each other. These “nested” statements can run code based on multiple conditions.
    
    Multiple statements nested within each other can become fairly lengthy. To counter this problem, a person can use “constructions” to create more compact code that requires fewer characters. To the trained eye, these constructions are much easier to read than multiple lines of statements.

2. Arrays are comprised of a set of data that’s represented by a single variable name. Elements represent each piece of data contained within an array, while the index refers to the numerical positioning of an element within the array. The index in any array always starts with 0. There are various JavaScript commands that control the elements within an array. The “length” property returns the total number of elements within an array. A user can change the value assigned to an array element by referencing the element’s index in a set of brackets. Array sizes are dynamic and can change when elements are needed. 

3. Variable scope refers to where in the code a declared variable can be used. Local variables are declared within a function. In fact, they are only available within the function and cease to exist when their function ends. Global variables are declared outside of a function and become available to all segments of the code. Local variables require the “var” keyword when declared inside a function, otherwise those variables will be regarded as global variables and would continue to be used after the function’s end.
